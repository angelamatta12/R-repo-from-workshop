##Introduction

This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

```{r DataRead}

gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")

```

```{r gdpLifeExp1997}

ggplot(gapminder_1997)+
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop/1e6)+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita", y = "Life Exp",
       title = "do people in countries with higher GDP live longer",
       size = "Population in millions")
